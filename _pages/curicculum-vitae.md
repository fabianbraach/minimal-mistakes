<small>Junior iOS Developer / July 2017 - March 2019</small>

After studying, I joined [CHECK24](https://www.check24.de/){:target="_blank"} in Hamburg as Junior iOS Developer. In Hamburg we are a team of five app developers, 3 for Android and 2 for iOS, and are responsible for the "Zahnzusatz", "Krankenkassen" and "Reiseversicherungen" parts of the CHECK24 app. In 2018 we also developed a new version of the "CHECK24 f√ºr Profis" app, which was formerly known as askCharlie and is now developed in Berlin.

## Education

### Philipps-University Marburg
<small>Bachelor of Science: Computer Science / October 2013 - June 2017</small>

After doing some pure Java in the first semesters, I participated in a practically orientated course, where we had to build an Android application in small groups. This was my first app I developed and since then I wanted to become an app developer. Because of my affection to Apple products and their ecosystem, I learned Swift in my free time and started creating my first iOS app.
