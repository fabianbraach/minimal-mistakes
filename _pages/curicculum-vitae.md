Below you can read something about my education, experiences and technologies I love to use.

## Work

### CHECK24 Vergleichsportal
<small>Junior iOS Developer / July 2017 - today</small>

After studying for almost four years, I joined [CHECK24](https://www.check24.de/) in Hamburg as Junior iOS Developer.

## Education

### Philipps-University Marburg
<small>Bachelor of Science: Computer Science / October 2013 - June 2017</small>

After doing some pure Java in the first semesters, I participated in a practically orientated course, where we had to build an Android application in small groups. This was my first app I developed and since then I wanted to become an app developer. Because of my affection to Apple products and their ecosystem, I learned Swift in my free time and started creating my first iOS app.
