## Education

### Philipps-University Marburg
<small>Bachelor of Science: Computer Science / October 2013 - June 2017</small>

After doing some pure Java in the first semesters, I participated in a practically orientated course, where we had to build an Android application in small groups. This was my first app I developed and since then I wanted to become an app developer. Because of my affection to Apple products and their ecosystem, I learned some Swift in my free time.
